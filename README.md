# jianpu-plugin
QML plugin for MuseScore, adding JianPu notation above the top staff.  

This plugin is not intended to be a main functioning part of MuseScore.  That is currently waiting for https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/pull/3614.  However, in the mean time, this is a simple plugin which can be used.  It is written for a specific project, therefore not all uses are taken into account.  
Some of the limitations built into initial implementation are:
Only one staff / one voice functionality
Only accounting for one octave dot below or above
No / minimal support for triplets of any type

PLEASE BE AWARE THAT
Commits prior to 2018-04-10 are for 2.1.3
Commits after 2018-04-10 are for 2.2
This is due to the font engine fix in 2.2
